;; and r-rotate, this is codified in the conditional expressions
;; which calculate the height of a new subtree by checking to see
;; whether or not both of the proposed new children of this new
;; subtree are empty, in which case the height of the new subtree
;; shall be 0, and otherwise, the usual calculation,
;;   (+ 1 (max height-of-left height-of-right))
;; is performed, where "height-of-left" and "height-of-right"
;; have already been calculated.
;;
;; After writing the initial version of the code, I have come to
;; understand that when one considers the height of an empty
;; tree (a tree ts for which ((lambda (x) (null? x)) ts) returns #t)
;; to be -1, then the height-difference calculations "work out

;; level:  so many of the leaves don't have siblings!  What's up with that?

;; data-nodes and internal nodes.  So, is's much less of an approximation
;; of a complete binary tree than I thought...
;; 
;; Ah!  It turned out to be a bit of a fine point:
;; Once I changed the theight function to define the height of an empty
;; tree as -1, then there was an easy distinction between the height of
;; an empty tree and the height of a single-node tree.  This made the
;; tree-structure more "complete," and obviated some special-case
;; code.

; I started the following version of the insert operator because
; I was starting to understand that it will not always be necessary
; to invoke the rebalance function on a resulting tree, whenever
; the insert was done in a tree for which the two subtrees were
; of equal height, or when the insert was into the shorter of
; the two subtrees of an unbalanced tree.  But it seems to me that,
; in order to determine whether or not a rebalance will be needed
; after inserting into the taller side of an unbalanced tree,
; the heights of the child subtrees of the taller side must also
; be examined, right?  And I fail to see how that is much cheaper
; than simply comparing the heights of the two subtrees which
; must be reassembled back together into the resulting tree, and
; rebalancing that tree when necessary.  Maybe in an imperative
; setting, it's cheaper to do the lookahead and avoid the rebalancing,
; but the cost of storing and checking the "balance factor's" in
; order to make a "rebalancing determination" possible does not
; seem to be any cheaper than "rebalancing the resulting new
; tree, if necessary, after inserting into the subtree."
;
; If the tree is unbalanced, and we're inserting into the taller of
; the subtrees, then rebalancing could be needed?
;
; IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INSERT OPERATION:
; All of the above ruminations were due to my fundamental misunderstanding
; of the nature of rebalancing.  It turns out that the most important
; thing is that rebalancing can only decrease the height of a tree, i.e.,
; if a tree increases in height because one of its subtrees has grown
; in height by 1, then rebalancing will shrink the height of the tree
; by 1.  This means that once a rebalancing operation has been performed,
; the rotated/rebalanced tree's height has not been changed, which means
; that more rotations are not necessary.
;
; Even an imperative solution is not going to be doing "lookahead."
; Instead, a flag value is passed back from a recursive call to indicate
; that a rotation has already been performed, and that further rotations
; are not necessary.  We could do this in a Scheme solution if the
; insertion function was designed in a tail-recursive manner, and used
; an explicit stack to manage the tree traversal, so that a separate,
; tail-recursive, "use-the-stack-to-walk-back-up-to-the-root" function
; could use a "we've already done a rotation/rebalancing, so you don't
; even need to check" flag...
;

;; So, a deletion function must:
;; calculate the root of the subtree which contains the key to
;; be deleted, and:
;; + Calculate the successor key (via a find-min calculation)
;; + Calculate a new right-hand subtree with the successor's key
;;   removed (via remove-min call)
;; + calculate a new, balanced subtree by:
;;   making the calculated successor the new subtree root,
;;   making the existing left-subtree as the left-subtree,
;;   making the right-hand-subtree calculated above the right-subtree
;;
;; this new subtree shall have to be balanced...

;; I now realize that the above will have to be generalized into a
;; "remove-this-key" function, I think.  Then, the delete-an-item
;; function shall have to:
;; + find the key-to-be-removed;
;; + find the successor of the key-to-be-removed (via find-min)
;; + calculate the new right-hand subtree, with the
;;   successor removed (via the "remove-this-key" function)
;; + calculate the new tree:
;;   with the successor key as the root,
;;   the present left tree as the left subtree,
;;   the calculated new right-hand subtree as the right subtree
;;   This new tree may need an r-rotate of the right-hand subtree,
;;   and may need to be l-rotated itself?
;;
;;   Yes, and this new tree is calculated by the rebalance function,
;;   and generalizing that functionality out into its own function
;;   made it possible to derive a very concise version of the
;;   function to calculate the result of inserting into a balanced
;;   search tree.

  ;; The left-hand tree is considered to be the taller one in this case.
  ;;
  ;; Here's a more "operational/imperative" interpretation:
  ;; This function recursively calculates a new left-hand tree
  ;; from the right-child of the existing left-hand tree, in order to
  ;; reduce the height of the left-hand tree, until we recursively reach
  ;; a left-hand tree which has the correct height.  Then, the two are
  ;; spliced together, with the split-key at the root, and that spliced
  ;; result is rebalanced.  This result is returned to the caller, which
  ;; derives a new tree from the left and right trees, with the key from
  ;; the root of the left-hand tree as the key that falls between the
  ;; returned right-hand tree, and the existing left-hand tree.  In other
  ;; words, this recursively derives a new right-hand tree by travelling
  ;; down the right-hand spine of the left-hand tree, stopping when
  ;; the height of the right-hand subtree is "small enough, but not too
  ;; small!"
  ;;
  ;; Base Case:
  ;; Both trees satisfy is-empty? predicate, so the only thing to do
  ;; is create a new tree with the split-key as the root.
  ;; When both trees satisfy the is-empty? predicate, they have equal
  ;; height as well.  The result will be the derivation of a tree of
  ;; height 0 with empty left and right subtrees.
  ;;
  ;; N.B. this is not explicit in the code.  It just happens
  ;; to be a consequence of the height tests performed by the code!
  ;;
  ;; Also, the two trees may be non-empty, but equal in height,
  ;; or they only differ in height by 1 (which is also implicit
  ;; in this situation...)  In this case, a balanced tree can be
  ;; built of the left tree, the split-key, and the right tree.
  ;;
  ;; Induction:
  ;; The left tree is taller than the right tree, so we need a new
  ;; right-hand tree (called new-tr) by (recursively) calculating:
  ;;   (lconcat-key (rchild tl) tr split-key)
  ;; and the new left-hand tree (named new-tl) is:  (lchild tl)
  ;; and the new key (named new-key) is:  (tkey tl).

  ;; of a shorter left-hand tree (i.e., (rchild tl)) to the right-hand
  ;; tree, named tr.  (The recursion is supposed to reduce the height
  ;; differences between the two trees.)
  ;;
  ;; Calculating the rebalanced version of the tree is necessary
  ;; because the tree calculated by the recursive call to lconcat-key
  ;; can differ in height from (lchild tl) by more than 1.
