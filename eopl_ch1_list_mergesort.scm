;; This appendR function, along with the idf identity function,
;; gives us a way to append to lists in O(1) time by 
;; implementing list append as function composition.
;; Then, list concatenation becomes a matter of passing the list
;; to be appended to the function-that-is-the-first-part-of-the-list.
;; And the cost is linear in the number of calls which are made
;; by that function-that-is-the-first-part-of-the-list.  We sort of
;; defer the work of building the list in the correct order until
;; the precise time at which we need to actually see the list.
;;
;; This approach to lists is the functional languages version
;; of "difference lists."
