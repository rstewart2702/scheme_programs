;; This is my first go at it; it's VERY "common-Lispy."
;; Also, this solution is not very efficient, because it simply
;; stuffs symbols into a list, and if the same symbol/name is repeated
;; multiple times inside the expression, named "exp" in the fresh-id
;; function, then it will be repeated in that list.  However, one would
;; hope that the expressions we write would not contain thousands of
;; variables, right?  If so, then we should implemented our "symbol
;; set" using some other kind of associative lookup, such as a hash-table
;; or balanced search tree, to keep performance from deteriorating.
